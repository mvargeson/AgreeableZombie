The gardener sent vegetables to town once a week by\r\n\t\t\tcarrier; he packed them in a big hamper.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThe gardener left the hamper by the garden gate, so that the carrier\r\n\t\t\tcould pick it up when he passed. Timmy Willie crept in through a hole in\r\n\t\t\tthe wicker-work, and after eating some peas&mdash;Timmy Willie fell fast\r\n\t\t\tasleep.\n",

The cook gave the carrier sixpence; the back\r\n\t\t\tdoor banged, and the cart rumbled away. But there was no quiet; there\r\n\t\t\tseemed to be hundreds of carts passing. Dogs barked; boys whistled in\r\n\t\t\tthe street; the cook laughed, the parlour maid ran up and down-stairs;\r\n\t\t\tand a canary sang like a steam engine.\n",

The continual noise upstairs\r\n\t\t\tmade him so nervous, that he dropped a plate. &quot;Never mind, they don't\r\n\t\t\tbelong to us,&quot; said Johnny.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&quot;Why don't those youngsters come back with the dessert?&quot; It should be\r\n\t\t\texplained that two young mice, who were waiting on the others, went\r\n\t\t\tskirmishing upstairs to the kitchen between courses. Several times they\r\n\t\t\thad come tumbling in, squeaking and laughing; Timmy Willie learnt with\r\n\t\t\thorror that they were being chased by the cat.

Johnny Town-mouse and his friends racketted about under the\r\n\t\t\tfloors, and came boldly out all over the house in the evening. One\r\n\t\t\tparticularly loud crash had been caused by Sarah tumbling downstairs\r\n\t\t\twith the tea-tray; there were crumbs and sugar and smears of jam to be\r\n\t\t\tcollected, in spite of the cat.\n",
